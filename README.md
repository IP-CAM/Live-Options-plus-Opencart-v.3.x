# Live Options+

The Live Options+ extension is for CMS Opencart 3.x. Live price calculation according to selected options or quantity. Equals sign as option prefix. Discounts and special prices for product options. And more...

The extension has been tested with OC 3.0.2.0 and default template, but should work with other OC 3.x and default-compatible templates and can be easily modified for newer OC versions and custom templates.
